## Your Mission
Before doing anything, read `.ai/README.md` first.
1. Read task.md from the repository root
2. Identify ALL tasks with Status: TODO
3. Implement each TODO task sequentially
4. Create solution files under problems/** directory

## Rules
- ONLY modify or create files under problems/**
- Follow the exact requirements in each task (language, complexity, etc.)
- Use clear variable names and add comments for time/space complexity
- Do NOT modify task.md or task descriptions
- Do NOT create new tasks or change requirements

## Output Structure
For each task (e.g., LC-001 Two Sum):
```
problems/001-two-sum/
├── solution.ts          # Main implementation
├── solution.test.ts     # Test cases (if needed)
└── README.md           # Explanation (optional)
```

## Error Handling
If requirements are unclear:
- STOP immediately
- Report the issue in output
- Do NOT make assumptions
